~~~~~Abstract~~~~~
CARDX is a web-based framework designed to enable users to create custom card games and other interactive narratives without any coding knowledge. The framework consists of a user-friendly visual interface that allows users to drag and drop different elements onto a virtual card, such as text, images, and sound effects.

To create a custom card game, the user can use CARDX's interface to define the rules of the game, the types of cards that can be played, and the win conditions. They can also create different decks of cards, each with their own unique content and attributes.

CARDX also allows users to create choose-your-own adventure stories and dating sims by defining branching paths and decision points within the game. Users can create different scenarios and outcomes based on the player's choices and actions, allowing for a wide range of storytelling possibilities.

Overall, CARDX is a flexible and intuitive framework that enables users to create a wide variety of interactive experiences without the need for coding knowledge.
